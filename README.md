## 🧠 About Me

I'm a software-focused engineer with a deep interest in building reliable, scalable systems that make data work *for* people — not the other way around. Whether it's building microservices, designing robust pipelines, or architecting cloud-first solutions, I enjoy working at the intersection of clean code and real-world impact.

My foundation in computer science taught me how to engineer systems. My analytics training taught me how to make them meaningful.
