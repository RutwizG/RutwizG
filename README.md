## 🧠 About Me

I'm a software-focused engineer with a deep interest in building reliable, scalable systems that make data work *for* people — not the other way around. Whether it's building microservices, designing robust pipelines, or architecting cloud-first solutions, I enjoy working at the intersection of clean code and real-world impact.

My foundation in computer science taught me how to engineer systems. My analytics training taught me how to make them meaningful.

## Interests

Outside of work, I draw deep inspiration from high-performance sports and the discipline behind them. I'm an avid follower of Formula 1, where I admire the precision, resilience, and strategic brilliance of drivers like Lewis Hamilton. I find similar motivation in cricket and tennis, closely following the careers of Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni, and Rafael Nadal—icons known not just for their success, but for their mental strength and work ethic. These athletes reinforce my belief that the process matters more than the result, a mindset I carry into both my professional and personal life. I also enjoy cooking as a creative outlet, often experimenting with flavors and cuisines as a way to unwind and explore culture through food.
